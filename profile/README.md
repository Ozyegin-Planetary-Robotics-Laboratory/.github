# <b>Planetary Robotics Laboratory</b>

## ðŸš€ Ozyegin University Rover Team

We are a group of passionate engineering students who are dedicated to planetary robotics. Our mission is to develop systems that tackle fundamental problems of remote operation on distant planets, and the prospect of discovering alien life.

Currently, our developed systems are used within the competitions we participate in; such as *University Rover Challenge*, *Anatolian Rover Challenge*, *European Rover Challenge* and *Teknofest*.
